# CS-255-System-Analysis-and-Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass is a system that provides online driver training, practice tests and provide on-the-road training if requested. The client is Liam(owner).

What did you do particularly well?
I think I did particularly well with the business requirement document.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would have read the UML diagram prompt more thoroughly, and actually submitted it.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user's needs by refining their stories which is important with regards to the system's functionality and the end user's satisfaction. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I would like to participate in a live Scrum meeting, and help define user stories.
